### Dependencies

- [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json).
  - Version 3.11.2-1
  - Included in [include/external/](https://github.com/Renjian-buchai/cinitpp/blob/main/include/external)
    <!-- As of the branch, does not work. Wait for it to be merged sooner or later.-->

### Building

You can use the makefile as reference. TLDR:

- Standard = C++17
- Source = src/main.cc main.exe
- If possible, -Wall -Wextra -Werror (Though I wouldn't mind if there were warnings, I'd still attempt to correct them, so to save time, it'd be best to use all warnings)
