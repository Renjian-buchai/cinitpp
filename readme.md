### Building

You can use the makefile as reference. TLDR:

- Standard = C++17
- Source = src/main.cc main.exe
- Additional include paths = include/external
- If possible, -Wall -Wextra -Werror (Though I wouldn't mind if there were warnings, I'd still attempt to correct them, so to save time, it'd be best to use all warnings)
